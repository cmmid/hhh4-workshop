## Background

Spatio-temporal models are used extensively to describe infectious disease dynamics while accounting for spatial heterogeneity in transmission risk. The Endemic-Epidemic modelling framework is a class of spatio-temporal models used for analysing subnational case count data implemented in the R package surveillance. It is characterised by its flexibility and ease of use, and it can easily integrate various data streams. It has been used to analyse outbreak dynamics in a wide range of settings, and applied to various diseases (including COVID-19, dengue, measles, and foot and mouth disease). This day-long workshop will provide an overview of the objectives and scope of Endemic-Epidemic models through a hands-on tutorial, followed by several short presentations and discussion on recent applications and future extensions of the framework.

## Organisers
* Alexis Robert
* Emily Nightingale
* Lloyd Chapman
* Sebastian Funk

## Introduction, tutorial and summary
* Johannes Bracher
* Leonhard Held

## Material for tutorial
The code for the tutorial part of the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/cmmid/hhh4-workshop) under [example_noro_rota](example_noro_rota/). In order to participate in the tutorial you will need to have R installed on your computer and to install the `surveillance` and `hhh4addon` R packages. Instructions for how to do this can be found [here](README.md).
